# NASAImages

This repository is just the result of the task from one czech company. ðŸ˜Œ

It fetches images with info from NASA' API and it allows you to search them with certain search query. After tap on image, you can see original photo of image, description and other info if API sends it.

**Important**: This API doesn't support paging (unfortunetely ðŸ˜£) so requests can take from 0,5-1s depending on your internet connection.
